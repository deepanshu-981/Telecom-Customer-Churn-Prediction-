## Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction-

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict which customers are likely to churn, enabling the company to take proactive measures to retain them.

The model is trained on historical customer data and aims to predict the probability of churn for each customer.
